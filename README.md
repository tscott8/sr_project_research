# Senior Project Research

## Introductory Notice
This is a test repo for all of the tinkering and research during the senior project process Winter 2017

## Getting Started
Arcane consists of 2 separate parts, server and client, like most web apps. You need to make sure both are configured correctly.
#### API Setup
1. To get started, make sure you have python3 installed.
2. Run `pip install virtualenv` to install a virtual environment kit.
3. From the project directory run `. ./setup.sh` to setup the project. (it should automagically handle everything)
4. You may need to create a new super user to use the admin features.

#### Client Setup
